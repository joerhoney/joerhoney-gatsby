              Most likely, you've come here because you need web or creative
              solutions. While I can list all of the solutions I can offer, I

            <p>
              Having a new website built doesn't have to be difficult or costly.
              Whether you need to enable your customer to place orders online or
              you just need a simple place on the web to stake your presence,
              one of these diverse web packages should be just what you need.

            <h3 className="tilt">Web Maintenance</h3>
            <p>
              As anyone with a website knows, websites need to be updated
              occasionally. Domain names, hosting and SSL certificates need to
              be renewed annually. Your company details can change and you need
              your website to reflect the update. Maybe you want to add a new
              feature, product. But every company has different website needs.
              That's why I put together several packages to cover any level of
              web maintenance.

            <h3 className="tilt">Web Design</h3>
            <p>
              Attraction is the responsibility of design. While any web presence
              is better than nothing, design is one of the main factors that
              governs a first impression, which can make or break your contact
              with a potential customer. A fresh modern look will garner new
              visitors in greater abundance than one that makes your business
              look old and rundown. My&nbsp;
              <a href="/solutions/website/">Website Packages</a> include web
              design, but if you already have a website and it needs a facelift,
              send me your website address for a free quote on a new look.

              Except in rare cases, having a website is crucial to establishing
              a presence on the web for any organization. People commonly rely
              on search engines to find you, and if you're not there‚Ä¶ ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
              My&nbsp;
              <Link to="/solutions/website">Website Packages</Link> include
              basic search engine optimization (SEO) to ensure you're not left
              in the dust while your neighbor gets all the clicks. But it is
              also important to recognize that a website isn't the only way your
              potential customers will look for what they need. Many use Yelp!,
              Google Maps (and other map apps), Facebook and other such
              directories. These packages are designed to establish such venues
              as needed and keep them up-to-date, to ensure your prospects get a
              chance to see how you shine.

            <p>
              Today, it is rare that a business can succeed without some kind of
              online presence, whether it's a good Yelp!<sup>¬Æ</sup> page, a
              business profile on Google<sup>¬Æ</sup> Maps, or a website,
              complete with an address, a presentation of products/solutions,
              etc. But these things are not hard to obtain. In fact, you've
              found the right place to get answers and real help. :j

              Many web developers want to charge a steady monthly rate,
              regardless of how much work they do for you. I only charge for
              what I deliver. Once your website is built you can let it sit
              there as long as you want at no cost from me. I'm here if you ever
