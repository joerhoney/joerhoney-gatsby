                Having a new website built doesn't have to be difficult or
                costly. Whether you need to enable your customer to place orders
                online or you just need a simple place on the web to stake your
                presence, one of these diverse web packages should be just what
                you need.

              <h3 className="">Web Maintenance</h3>
              <p>
                As anyone with a website knows, websites need to be updated
                occasionally. Domain names, hosting and SSL certificates need to
                be renewed annually. Your company details can change and you
                need your website to reflect the update. Maybe you want to add a
                new feature, product. But every company has different website
                needs. That's why I put together several packages to cover any
                level of web maintenance.

              <h3 className="">Web Design</h3>
              <p>
                Attraction is the responsibility of design. While any web
                presence is better than nothing, design is one of the main
                factors that governs a first impression, which can make or break
                your contact with a potential customer. A fresh modern look will
                garner new visitors in greater abundance than one that makes
                your business look old and rundown. My&nbsp;
                <a href="/solutions/website/">Website Packages</a> include web
                design, but if you already have a website and it needs a
                facelift, send me your website address for a free consultation
                for a new look.

              <p>
                Except in rare cases, having a website is crucial to establishing
                a presence on the web for any organization. People commonly rely
                on search engines to find you, and if you're not there‚Ä¶ ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

                <Link to="/solutions/website">Website Packages</Link> include
                basic search engine optimization (SEO) to ensure you're not left
                in the dust while your neighbor gets all the clicks. But it is
                also important to recognize that a website isn't the only way your
                potential customers will look for what they need. Many use Yelp!,
                Google Maps (and other map apps), Facebook and other such
                directories. These packages are designed to establish such venues
                as needed and keep them up-to-date, to ensure your prospects get a
                chance to see how you shine.

              Today, it is rare that a business can succeed without some kind of
              online presence, whether it's a good Yelp!<sup>¬Æ</sup> page, a
              business profile on Google<sup>¬Æ</sup> Maps, or a website,
              complete with an address, a presentation of products/solutions,
              etc. But these things are not hard to obtain. In fact, you've
              found the right place to get answers and real help. :j

              Many web developers want to charge a steady monthly rate,
              regardless of how much work they do for you. I only charge for
              what I deliver. Once your website is built you can let it sit
              there as long as you want at no cost from me. I'm here if you ever
