            <p>
              As a lifetime artist, I found a career in design in 2006. That
              quickly lead to a web development opportunity, and I've been
              designing and coding ever since‚Ä¶

            <h2>Journey of an Artist</h2>
            <p>
              I have been an artist since my childhood in rural Northern
              California. I spent most of my free time creating and designing
              fictional vehicles, characters and creatures to be featured in a
              comic book series one day. As a teenager I began exploring my
              ability to produce music while continuing to practice
              illustration.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a top art student I was granted the opportunity to attend the
              CSSSA program (California State Summer School for the Arts),
              located at the CalArts campus in Valencia, CA. There, I gained a
              world of knowledge and experience in traditional animation.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next year (1998), I moved to Southern California, where life
              now seemed to be traveling a million miles per hour. I held
              various jobs until I landed my first design opportunity in 1999,
              at a web marketing agency called Success Makers. Within the first
              two weeks they asked me to learn HTML, so I quickly began my
              career as a web developer at the same time.
            </p>
            <p>
              In a few years' time, I began picking up small side jobs, drawing
              for acquaintances who needed illustrations for marketing campaigns
              and other purposes. Soon I became familiar with the processes of
              freelancing. Freelancing has also greatly facilitated the
              opportunity to self-train and gain a wide range of experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
              And the rest is pretty much history. I have been working graphic
              design and web developer jobs since then. üôÇ
