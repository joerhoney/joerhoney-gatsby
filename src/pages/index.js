          </h2>
          <p>
            Pardon my code humor, I've been in this industry for
            {since("Jan, 1, 2006")} years. Because that's how old I amâ€¦ Okay,
            maybe I'm a little older than that. &#128513;
            <br />
            <br />I design, build and maintain websites and web apps, using
            efficient and cost-effective modern development technologies.
            Resolving difficult UI/UX challenges and creating new and exciting
            experiences makes me tick. Likewise, being the one to zap that bug
            and ward off the hackers is a thrill worth fighting for.
